[TL;DR](#final-result)

I didn’t expect building this feature alone would take almost three days, but I literally started everything from scratch. **JUST** building a reactions feature — yes, the one below 😁

I didn't make any **analysis** first, I immediately jumped into building the database, trial & error, and refactoring. Partly because I didn't know where to start, partly because I was lazy — but mostly because I just wanted to start coding 😂

In this article, I’ll explain the features I built and the concepts behind them, though this isn’t a full step-by-step tutorial.

Who knows, maybe you want to build something similar — feel free to “borrow” the good parts 😉

Alright, let’s go!

## Features

First, I imagined the rough idea of what I wanted this reactions feature to look like.

Here’s what I ended up with:

- **Multiple Reactions**

  There are <IH>claps</IH>, <IH color="blue">wow</IH>, and others. It should also be easy to add more reactions in the future.

  <br />

- **Batch Reactions**

  Users can give multiple reactions of the same type, like 20x <IH>claps</IH> or 10x <IH color="blue">wow</IH>.

  <br />

- **Section Reactions**

  You can track _where_ the user reacted — for example, giving 10x <IH>claps</IH> in the section titled **“Features”** like this one.

## Concept

The hardest part was actually the REST API and database schema. Lots of refactoring and backend-related decisions.

Please understand if something looks odd — I'm not a backend expert ✌

### Database

It’s been three years since I last touched a database. The last time was during my final university project.

First I had to decide where to host it. SQL vs NoSQL didn’t matter since this was just experimentation. I searched for free hosting and found **MongoDB Atlas (shared)**, which was perfect.

Since I used **Prisma**, migrating later wouldn’t be too hard.

Let’s move to the schema (focusing only on the reactions feature).

### ContentMeta table

Stores the post metadata.

No title, date, or content needed, since posts are built locally from MDX.

```scheme {4}
model ContentMeta {
  id          String

  slug        String
  createdAt   DateTime
}
```
